When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating or when switching devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In case I'm not ready to sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is a way to copy a repo to your github account, clones are a way to copy
    a repo to the working directory and branches are made on a file to preview or
    develop independently and remerge with the original project locally. Forks are used
    to contribute or build upon another's work. Clones are used to use repos personally.
    And branches are used to develop independently of the main project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
