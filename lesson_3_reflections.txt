When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating or when switching devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In case I'm not ready to sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is a way to copy a repo to your github account, clones are a way to copy
    a repo to the working directory and branches are made on a file to preview or
    develop independently and remerge with the original project locally. Forks are used
    to contribute or build upon another's work. Clones are used to use repos personally.
    And branches are used to develop independently of the main project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To compare the current state and view any changes to make reviewing and merging
    with collaborators easier.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I have normally collaborated on projects (unrelated to code) via Google Drive
    and Whatsapp/FBMessenger. This would have been easier than Github because none
    of my teammates had experience with it (including me). But in retrospect, the project
    would have been much more organized had we all been using Git and GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
