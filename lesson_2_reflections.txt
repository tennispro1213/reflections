What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git file is added to the directory. It allows git to begin tracking the files' history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and repository. It allows us to bundle up related files and commit them together instead of committing the entire repository.
